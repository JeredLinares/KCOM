# Background
It is important to realize that many slack apps are hosted on remote systems and when these apps are installed on a workspace. This application is similar and makes use of data pulled and saved from the Kellogg workspace. We believe that informed consent is important, but it is impossible to expect opt-in from all members of the workspace. Therefore we will work to both safeguard this data and use it only for the improved experience of members of the Kellogg workspace.
